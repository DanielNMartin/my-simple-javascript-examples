/* 
Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects 
that contain multiple values stored in a list. Array objects can be stored in variables and 
dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can 
access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with
the list, like loop through it and do the same thing to every value. Maybe we've got a series
of product items and their prices stored in an array, and we want to loop through them all 
and print them out on an invoice, while totaling all the prices together and printing out 
the total price at the bottom.
